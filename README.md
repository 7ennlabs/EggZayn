# EggZayn
EggZayn analyzes EEG data to predict which movement (left/right fist, both fists, both feet) a person is thinking about. Using deep learning with transformer blocks, it processes motor cortex signals to enable brain-computer interfaces that could help paralyzed individuals control devices through thought alone.
